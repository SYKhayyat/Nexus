//! Which backends have never met the manager they are named after, and why.
//!
//! **A user cannot currently tell a backend with a real lifecycle behind it from one that has
//! never run.** They are listed side by side, described in the same words, and one of them is a
//! claim nothing has ever checked. That is the whole of this module: the claim is still made,
//! and it is now made *with its standing attached*.
//!
//! This table used to live in `tests/lifecycle_coverage_union_tests.rs`, which is the only place
//! that sees both harnesses at once. Keeping it there meant the repository knew the answer and
//! the program could not say it — and a fact known only to a test is a fact no user gets. The
//! test now reads **this** table rather than a copy of it, which is `F7`'s lesson applied rather
//! than repeated: a gate that reads a transcription reports on the transcription.
//!
//! **The bar for an entry is that a harness genuinely *cannot* do it** (`Q17`). A cost is not a
//! reason — "it downloads 2 GB" is an argument for baking it into an image, not for an
//! exemption — and "it touches the real machine" is not a reason either, because every package
//! manager does. `stack` is listed with its reason stated as a cost precisely so the ceiling
//! counts it instead of a harness exemption hiding it.
//!
//! **What it does not mean.** An entry here is not "this backend is broken" and not "this
//! backend is untested": every one of them has unit coverage, a plan-smoke, and a place in the
//! registry audit. It means exactly one thing — *no harness in this repository has driven a real
//! install → list → binary-on-PATH → remove through it* — so if it is wrong about the manager,
//! nothing here would know.

/// A backend no harness can reach with a real lifecycle, and why.

        "no CI leg is NixOS — a cost rather than an impossibility, which this table is supposed \
         to refuse, so it is recorded with a receipt and a price instead of an excuse. THE \
         RECEIPT: the whole lifecycle was driven by hand on NixOS 26.05 (Yarara) under WSL on \
         2026-08-16 — `nixos:hello` declared, the generated module written into a root-owned \
         /etc/nixos, the import inserted into the real configuration.nix, `nixos-rebuild switch` \
         run, and `hello` found at /run/current-system/sw/bin/hello saying `Hello, world!`; then \
         `list` read it back, undeclaring it took it off PATH, and the machine still dry-builds. \
         That run found FOUR defects every hermetic layer had passed, one of which reported \
         `Status: SUCCESS` over a machine where nothing had been installed. THE PRICE: \
         `nixos/nix` cannot stand in — probed the same day, it is the Nix package manager on a \
         minimal base with no /etc/NIXOS, no /run/current-system, no `nixos-rebuild` and no \
         systemd. Closing this wants a NixOS image that can run `nixos-rebuild`, or NixOS-WSL on \
         a Windows runner. NARROWER AGAIN, 2026-08-16: the services-and-perimeter module has now \
         been handed to a real `nixos-rebuild` on that same NixOS 26.05. `nixos-rebuild build` \
         over a configuration importing a module carrying `hello`, `services.cron.enable`, \
         `networking.firewall.enable` and both port lists EVALUATED AND BUILT a complete system \
         closure (`nixos-system-nixos-26.05pre-git`), and the negative control — one option \
         nixpkgs does not have — failed with `The option ... does not exist`, so the check is \
         not vacuous. `switch` on that distro fails at ACTIVATION with a dbus error, and the \
         control settles whose fault that is: `nixos-rebuild switch` with the machine's own \
         configuration and no Shall in it fails identically (exit 4). What that same run DID \
         prove about Shall is the rollback — the failed switch put both /etc/nixos files back \
         and named them, which no hermetic test can stage. WHAT IS LEFT: activation, and only \
         activation. Automatically, `scripts/nix-validate.sh --evaluate` now merges every \
         generated module into a real NixOS module system (`<nixpkgs/nixos>`), which is where a \
         wrong option name arrives — parsing never saw one. An evaluation is not an activation.",

         `gentoo/stage3:latest` ships `/etc/portage/binrepos.conf/gentoo.conf`, so an official \
         BINARY host is configured out of the box, and what the image lacks is the portage tree \

    //
    // Two things the image had to be taught, and both are worth keeping because neither is about
    // guix being unusual — they are about what an image owes a harness. `guix install` writes to
    // `/root/.guix-profile/bin` and tells you to put it on PATH yourself, so the canary was
    // installed and invisible; and a guix profile starts EMPTY, so the history proofs had no git

    // bootstraps the toolchain THROUGH slackpkg — installing the `d`, `l` and `n` series, which is
    // the lesson the file records: slackpkg resolves series, not package names — and the Rust it
    // gets builds Shall. It now runs the full harness, drives its own install → list → binary →
    // remove, and joins the CI matrix.
    //
    // Recorded rather than deleted silently, because what it cost is the point: while slackpkg had
    // never met its own manager, two defects hid behind it — it sorted below the language managers
    // (VI.7) and it was sent a `--` it reads as the search pattern (VI.9). Neither is visible from
    // an argv test, and both were found in the first hour the image existed.
    // `yay` and `paru` were here, exempted because "AUR helpers refuse to run as root and the
    // container sweep runs as root", with the closing move named in the entry itself: "closable
    // with a non-root leg on the arch image". That leg exists now — `Dockerfile.arch` creates an
    // unprivileged user and Shall escalates through `sudo -n` for the backends whose
    // `needs_root` is true, which is the behaviour `register_aur_helper` always assumed. Both
    // have canaries in `run-in-container.sh` and are driven for real.
